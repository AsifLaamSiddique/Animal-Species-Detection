# Animal Species Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying images of animals into various species using TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate image classification and supports data augmentation for enhanced model performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic rescaling and augmentation of image data.
- **Model Architecture**: Sequential CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- **Training and Validation**: Trains the model on a labeled dataset and evaluates it on validation data.
- **Random Image Prediction**: Tests the trained model on a random image from the test dataset.
